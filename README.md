# Perturbed Report Discrimination for Biomedical Vision-Language Models

## Overview
The approach enhances vision-language models by introducing text perturbation techniques for improving semantic understanding in biomedical applications.


## Installation
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone [repository link]
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
The model is trained on a curated dataset of biomedical images and associated reports. The dataset includes perturbed reports generated by specific text manipulation rules.

## Usage
Detailed instructions on how to use the model for training and inference.

## Methodology
### Approach
The model distinguishes between original biomedical reports and their perturbed versions, paired with images. 

#### Text Perturbation Methods
| Perturbation Type | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| Shuffle Words | Randomly shuffles words in a sentence |
| Reverse Sentence | Reverses the order of words in a sentence |
| ... | ... |

### Model Architecture
Description of the model architecture and its components.

## Evaluation
Evaluation metrics and results demonstrating the model's performance on biomedical vision-language tasks.
